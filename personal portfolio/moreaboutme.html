	<p>I was born in Palo Alto, California and lived in San Jose for three years of my life. As I grew older with my two other sisters, my parents decided that it was time to move to a new place where three growing girls would have more room. We then packed our bags and moved to San Ramon, California. I spent most of my childhood in the same city where I played outdoors with the neighborhood kids. Because I had always expressed an interest in music, I began to learn the clarinet on top of the piano. </p>

	<p>My passion for volunteering developed during my freshmen year and into my sophomore year. Interested in following this passion, I became the president of the volunteer club at our school, Key Club.   </p>
	<p> This summer I was accepted into the Girls Who Code program. So far, it has been such an eye opening and educational experience. As well as learning to code in several languages, I have met many incredible girls who have proven themsevles to be exceptional. Hopefully I can continue my coding journey in the future as my knowledge expands.</p>
